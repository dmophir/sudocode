# Guidelines

This repository uses Typescript. Use Typescript for all implementations.

This project uses sudocode for spec and issue management. Make sure to update issue status when working on an issue and close the issue when done with work.
When writing specs and creating issues that refer to specs, make sure to created references to bi-directionally link issues and specs. Refer to spec and issue content to gather more context about your current task. When editing spec or issue content, you can use your provided MVP tools but you can also update their contents directly by modifying the markdown files in ./sudocode/specs/ and ./sudocode/issues.
